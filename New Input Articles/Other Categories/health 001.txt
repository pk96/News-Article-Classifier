A new clinical treatment trial launched Friday and UW Medicine researchers are looking for COVID-19 patients to test the effectiveness of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.

UW researchers want to enroll 630 people who currently have the COVID-19 virus.

Researchers say this particular study looks at COVID-19 patients who do not need to go to the hospital yet.

Researchers are testing two combinations. One is hydroxychloroquine. The other is hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. Researchers are also using a placebo.

“We are trying to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 and to prevent the complications of needing to go into the hospital. By treating early, the study is a bit different than other studies than in the media --where many times they are already treating patients in the hospital and are very sick. So, our goal is to see if we can interrupt that process by treating earlier,” said Dr. Christine Johnston, the co-investigator with the UW Medicine clinical trial.

Johnston said the treatment trial hopes to prevent patients from going to the hospital and to prevent them from developing pneumonia.

UW Medicine is looking for patients in cities nationwide including Boston, Chicago, and New York.

Johnston said there are a number of different trials nationwide studying this same anti-malaria drug.

UW Medicine launched another trial two weeks ago involving hydroxychloroquine. That trial looks at using the drug to *prevent a COVID-19 virus infection.

The trial launched today is designed to *treat people who already have the infection.

Researchers expect results to be available by July.
